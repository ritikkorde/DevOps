 Kubernetes /K8s
is an open source platform designed to automate the deployment,scaling and management of containerized application/containers.
Container Orchestration /container management tool- Kubernetes manages clusters of containers,ensuring they run efficiently across multiple machine.
Features of K8s
- Container orchestration 
- automated scaling
- Self -Healing
- service Discovery & Load balancing
- Storage Orchestration: Kubernetes allows you to automatically mount the storage system of your choice, whether from local storage, cloud providers, or network storage systems.
- Automated Rollouts & Rollbacks: Kubernetes can manage the deployment of new versions of applications without downtime, and roll back to previous versions if something goes wrong.

Architecture of K8s
1)Kubernetes only manage pods not container
2)Worker node/minion
i)Kubelet
- kubelet is the agent running on node
- kubelet communicate the controller manager through API server & send all information to master .
- Observe and manage the pods(how many container should there be in a pod)
- kubelet ensures that the desired state of the containers as defined by master kubelet sees and control all these things
- 

ii) Kube-Proxy
- All networking should be done by kube-proxy
- Assigning ip adress to to pod
