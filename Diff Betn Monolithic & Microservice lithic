<h2>Difference between Monolithic & Microservice lithic architecture</h2>
The terms "monolithic" and "microlithic" typically refer to different architectural styles or approaches  / different ways to design and build software application  in **software design or system architecture**
**Monolithic Architecture:**
**Definition:** Monolithic architecture refers to a traditional architectural style where all components of an application are combined into a single executable codebase and deployed as a single unit.
In a microservices architecture, an application is broken down into smaller, independent services. Each service has its own well-defined functionality and communicates with other services through APIs (application programming interfaces)
