**Difference between Stateless & Stateful application**

Stateless and stateful applications refer to how they manage and store information (state) during interactions with users or other systems. 

**Stateless Application:**

**Definition:** A stateless application does not retain client data or session information between requests. Each request from a client to the server is treated as an independent transaction that is unrelated to any previous request.

Characteristics:
<li>No Session Context: The server does not store information about the client's previous interactions.
<li>Scalability: Stateless applications are easier to scale horizontally because each request can be handled by any available instance of the application server without needing to maintain session affinity.
<li>Simplicity: They are simpler in design because they do not need to manage or synchronize state between multiple instances or servers.</li>

Examples:
<li>RESTful APIs: Where each request from a client includes all necessary information for the server to process without relying on previous interactions.
<li>Stateless web applications: Where authentication tokens are used for each request, and no session state is stored on the server side.</li>

Advantages:
<li>Scalability: Easier to scale horizontally by adding more servers or instances.
<li>Fault Tolerance: Failures in one server instance do not affect others.
<li>Simplified Design: No need to manage session state synchronization.</li>

Disadvantages:
<li>Performance Overhead: Each request may require all necessary data to be sent, which can increase latency.
<li>Data Repetition: Clients may need to resend data in each request.</li>


**Stateful Application:**

**Definition:** A stateful application maintains client data or session information across multiple requests from the same client or user session. The server retains the state of the client's interactions and can provide context-sensitive responses.

Characteristics:
<small>Session Context: The server retains information about the client's state across multiple requests.
Complexity: More complex to implement and scale because state must be managed and synchronized between instances or servers.
Resource Management: Requires mechanisms to handle session data storage and retrieval</small>
Examples:
<br>-Online shopping carts: Where the server stores items added by the user until they are ready to check out.</br>
<br>-Database applications: Where the server maintains a connection to the database and stores user-specific data during the session.</br>
Advantages:

Efficiency: Reduced data repetition as not all data needs to be sent with each request.
Enhanced User Experience: Can provide personalized responses based on stored session data.
Simplicity for Users: Users donâ€™t need to resend data with every request.
Disadvantages:

Scalability Challenges: Harder to scale horizontally because session state must be synchronized across multiple servers or instances.
Increased Complexity: Requires mechanisms for session management and handling session failures.
Fault Tolerance: Failures in one server instance can affect the entire session.
Choosing Between Stateless and Stateful Applications:
<br>-Stateless applications are preferred for systems where scalability and fault tolerance are critical, such as in microservices architecture or highly distributed systems.</br>
<br>-Stateful applications are suitable when maintaining session context or personalized user experiences is necessary, such as in online banking applications or collaborative tools where maintaining user state across interactions is beneficial.</br>
