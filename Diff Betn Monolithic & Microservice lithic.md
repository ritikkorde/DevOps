<h2>Difference between Monolithic & Microservice lithic architecture</h2>

The terms "monolithic" and "microlithic" typically refer to different architectural styles or approaches in  **software design or system architecture** / different ways to design and build software application .

**Monolithic Architecture:**
**Definition:** Monolithic architecture refers to a traditional architectural style where all components of an application are combined into a single executable codebase and deployed as a single unit.<br>-Monolithic architecture is suitable for smaller applications, simpler projects, or when rapid development is a priority. It can be easier to develop and maintain initially.</br>


**Microlithic Architecture:**
In a microservices architecture, an application is broken down into smaller, independent services. Each service has its own well-defined functionality and communicates with other services through APIs (application programming interfaces) <br>-Microservices architecture is better for complex applications that require frequent updates, scalability, and independent development of features. However, it requires more upfront planning and can be more complex to manage.</br>
