## Waterfall Model

- **Sequential Approach:** Progresses through predefined phases in a linear fashion: Requirements > Design > Implementation > Verification > Maintenance.
- **Structured:** Each phase typically relies on the completion of the previous one.
- **Documentation Heavy:** Emphasizes extensive documentation early in the process.
- **Less Flexible:** Changes are difficult to accommodate once a phase is completed.
- **Suitable for Stable Requirements:** Best used when requirements are well-understood and unlikely to change significantly.

## Agile Methodology

- **Iterative and Incremental:** Develops software in small, incremental builds.
- **Flexible:** Allows for changes and iterations throughout the development process.
- **Collaborative:** Values customer collaboration and feedback over rigid contracts and plans.
- **Focus on Individuals and Interactions:** Emphasizes teamwork and face-to-face communication.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Iterates based on feedback and changes priorities as needed.

## Key Differences

- **Flexibility:** Agile is highly adaptive to changes in requirements, while Waterfall is less flexible once a phase is completed.
- **Approach:** Waterfall follows a sequential approach, whereas Agile uses an iterative and incremental approach.
- **Feedback:** Agile encourages frequent customer feedback and iteration, while Waterfall waits until the end of the project for testing and feedback.
