## Continuous Integration (CI)

**Purpose:** CI is the practice of frequently integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository.

**Process:**
- Developers submit their code changes to a central repository multiple times a day.
- Automated build and test processes are triggered to ensure new code integrates well with the existing codebase.

**Automation:**
- Automated build and test processes are triggered to ensure the new code integrates well with the existing codebase.

**Benefits:**
- Detects integration issues early.
- Reduces the time and effort needed to merge code changes.
- Ensures the software is always in a working state.

## Continuous Delivery (CD)

**Purpose:** CD extends CI by automating the deployment process so that code changes can be released to a staging or production environment automatically after passing tests.

**Process:**
- After successful integration, the code is automatically packaged and prepared for deployment.
- Deployment to production may still require manual approval, but the process is streamlined.

**Benefits:**
- Speeds up the release of new features and fixes.
- Ensures the code is always in a deployable state.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

**Purpose:** Continuous Deployment goes a step further than Continuous Delivery by automating the entire release process to production.

**Process:**
- Every code change that passes all automated tests is automatically deployed to production without manual intervention.

**Benefits:**
- Rapid and reliable delivery of new features and updates.
- Minimizes the time between code changes and deployment.

## Summary

- **CI:** Focuses on merging code changes frequently and running automated tests to detect issues early.
- **CD (Continuous Delivery):** Automates the process of preparing code for release, ensuring it can be deployed at any time.
- **CD (Continuous Deployment):** Automates the entire release process, deploying code changes to production automatically.

In essence, CI ensures code changes are integrated smoothly, while CD (in both forms) ensures that those changes can be delivered to users quickly and reliably.
